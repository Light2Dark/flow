Game made using Unity. Had big ideas for it, but the actual gameplay doesn't seem to be very fun. Music is awesome. There are some scaling issues which I will resolve when I have the time for it. Credits are in the game for music, etc.

# flow

A Unity-made mobile game to implement some new skills and an interesting idea for a game. You have to bounce around the walls, collect the shining orbs before the time runs out! Accelerate and pause using the buttons.

## Installation

To install in your phone:

(**Currently unavailable on Playstore & Appstore so this is to install manually**)

**Android:** 
1. Download and transfer the PogGamesv1.apk file to your phone.
2. Install the app in your phone.
3. Enable installation of unknown apps in your phone (if needed).
4. Your phone will install it.
5. Run the game!

**Apple**

1. I don't think it works because Apple has strict policies on manual installation of foreign apps but maybe in the far future.
